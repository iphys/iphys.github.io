Finally my web site is up and running.
It took about two years to reach a point where
I could figure out how to create a web site
in the way I want to.

- Manage the web site sourcre files with git.
- Generate static HTML pages.
- Automate the conversion from source to HTML.
- Use simple site design in dark mode.

The answer was to use GitHub, GitHub Pages, and Jekyll.
I found this combination quickly,
but figuring out how to properly set these things up
was non-trivial for me because I had to learn
a lot about Git, GitHub, GitHub Pages, and Jekyll.
